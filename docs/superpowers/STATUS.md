# Project Status

Read this file first at the start of a session.
It is only an index: the
authoritative status of each spec/plan lives in its own YAML front-matter
(`status: draft|approved|in-progress|done`, plans also carry `progress: n/m`).
Do not open docs marked `done` unless the current work touches that area.

## Active

- spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-viewer-search-design.md`
- spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-ci-tui-e2e-design.md`

## Known issues (deferred, no spec yet)

- 2026-10-18: annotate card loses keyboard focus while the main agent is active; keys fall through to the underlying main UI.
  Host facts verified from source: pi-tui routes all input to a single `focusedComponent`; `showOverlay` captures focus on open; no agent-event handler calls `setFocus`; `hideOverlay` fires only on fullscreen exit / session invalidate / `/reload`.
  Prime suspect: the host's blocked-then-restore overlay focus machinery (pi-tui `setFocusInternal`) races when a mid-run dialog (e.g. tool confirmation) yields focus back to the editor instead of the overlay.
  Fix direction: grab the `OverlayHandle` via `ctx.ui.custom`'s `onHandle` and re-assert `handle.focus()` on agent lifecycle events while the card is open; optionally file an upstream pi issue.
  Deferred: the scenario (agent active + card open) is rare in practice.

- 2026-10-19: annotate path-completion manual E2E still owed on master (plan `2026-10-18-annotate-path-completion.md` Task 2 Step 3, merge proceeded on review evidence per user direction).
  Cover: Tab completion, directory drill-down, empty-result fallback, and the resume-cwd case (launch pi in directory B, resume a session stored with cwd A, verify relative-path completion and the handler agree - the scenario fix `e0e0067` targets).
  The resume-cwd case is rare and not reproducible in the current environment, so it stays a deferred manual check.
